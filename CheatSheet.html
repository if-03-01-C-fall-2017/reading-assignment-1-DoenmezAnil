	<h3><u>What are the general components of a url?</u></h3>
	<strong><p style="background-color: white; width: 30em;">In the world wide web are the URL's for example when you have a file named index.html
	the adress is at first the http:// so the HyperText Transfer Protocol and the domain for example: CheatSheet.de so the first part is http://CheatSheet.de, but
	you have to open a file so in this case it's index.html(it's the main file), so the adress will be http://CheatSheet.de/index.html, so the last part of the adress
	is the path to the file.</p>
